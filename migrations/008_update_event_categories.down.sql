-- Rollback event_category enum update
-- Note: PostgreSQL doesn't support removing enum values
-- This is a placeholder for rollback documentation

-- To fully rollback, you would need to:
-- 1. Update all events using new categories to old ones
-- 2. Drop and recreate the enum type
-- This is not implemented as it's destructive and should be done carefully
